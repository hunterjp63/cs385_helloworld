# cs385_helloworld
Repo to complete the CS385 Hello World Assignment. Includes contents related to an Unreal Engine tutorial

Video is here, GitHub won't allow large .mp4 files to be viewed, so it's on google drive for your convinience: https://drive.google.com/file/d/175dAS93Z6BD0jaitk6o4oUDMV6GV-BSV/view?usp=sharing  

The difference between the tutorial and what I made was a different dash animation.

Please note that I was able to follow the tutorial, but the map made the files too large to fit into one pull request, so I switched to show the game functions in the default third person unreal map.

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_SPuvO_l1w "How to Make Your First Game in Unreal Engine 5 in 2025 - Full Beginner Course" by GorkaGames
