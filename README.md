# cs385_helloworld
Repo to complete the CS385 Hello World Assignment. Includes contents related to an Unreal Engine tutorial

The difference between the tutorial and what I made is the choice in map, I used a different one than the tutorial did.

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_SPuvO_l1w "How to Make Your First Game in Unreal Engine 5 in 2025 - Full Beginner Course" by GorkaGames
