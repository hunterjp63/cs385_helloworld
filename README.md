# cs385_helloworld
Repo to complete the CS385 Hello World Assignment. Includes contents related to an Unreal Engine tutorial

The difference between the tutorial and what I made was a different dash animation.

Please note that I was able to follow the tutorial, but the map made the files too large to fit into one pull request, so I switched to show the game functions in the default third person unreal map.

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_SPuvO_l1w "How to Make Your First Game in Unreal Engine 5 in 2025 - Full Beginner Course" by GorkaGames
